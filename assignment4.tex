\paragraph{Problem 1} Show that Turing machines with left reset recognize
the class of Turing-recognizable languages.
\paragraph{} Going left is equivalent to reset plus r-1, that is to say if a reset is encountered the tape head would reset all the way to the left, then move right to a position of r-1.


\paragraph{Problem 2} Give the informal descriptions for Turing machines that decide the following languages

\begin{enumerate}[a)]

\item $\{w \;|\; \text{ w contains twice as many 0s as 1s } \}$

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item Scan right until a 1 is encountered. If a 1 exists, cross it off. If no 1 exists, scan for o's and reject if found. If no 0's and no 1's, accept.
\item Return tape head to the beginning.
\item Scan until a 0 is encountered, cross off. if no zero is found, reject. else continue scanning again for another 0. If a 0 is found cross it off, or reject if no 0 is found.
\item Return tape to beginning
\item Go to step 1
\end{enumerate}

\item  $\{a + b = c \;|\; a, b, c \in $\{0, 1$\} ∗ a\text{and the binary numbers represented by a and b sum to c} \}$


\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Problem 3} Show that the Turing-decidable languages are closed under the following:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]

\item Union
\item Intersection
\item Complement

\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Problem 4} Show that the Turing-recognizable languages are closed under concatenation.
